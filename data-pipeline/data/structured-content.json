The two primary techniques for customizing these models are: Prompt Engineering: The art of crafting text instructions to guide the model toward desired outputs. For most use cases, prompt engineering is faster, cheaper, and more transparent than fine-tuning. Always start with prompt engineering to achieve your desired results. Fine-Tuning: The process of retraining models on domain-specific data to specialize them for particular tasks or industries. Only consider fine-tuning if prompt engineering cannot achieve your success criteria, or if you need to adapt the model to highly specialized data. (Note: Fine-tuning is outside the scope of this introductory course but is mentioned for completeness.)",

          "content": "Once you have an adapted model, there are three primary approaches for building applications. All three approaches require effective, well-crafted prompts and can leverage either foundational or fine-tuned models as their reasoning engine: Single-Step LLM Applications: The LLM is used in a single, atomic step to complete a task (e.g., summarization, classification, translation). The application logic is simple, and the LLM is called once per user request. With advanced reasoning models, the LLM may use its own internal workflow and control flow to break down complex tasks, but this happens transparently within the single call. Workflow-Based LLM Applications: The application consists of multiple, code-defined steps, each of which may involve an LLM call or tool use. The sequence of steps is predetermined and controlled by the developer, not the LLM. Examples include retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multi-stage data processing, or document extraction pipelines. Agentic LLM Applications: A software system that wraps around the LLM, operating in a loop‚Äîobserving its environment, using the LLM's reasoning to decide what to do next, and taking actions to achieve its goals. Agentic applications often use workflow-based patterns internally but differ by allowing the LLM to participate in the control flow, making autonomous decisions to achieve objectives.",

User: Asks, \"Do I have any meetings this afternoon, and what's the weather forecast for that time?\" Host: Uses the LLM to interpret the request and determines it needs to: Check the user's calendar for meetings this afternoon (calendar tool) Get the weather forecast for the meeting time (weather tool) Host: Uses Client 1 to connect to Server 1 (Calendar Tool), which returns: \"You have a meeting at 3:00 PM.\" Host: Uses Client 2 to connect to Server 2 (Weather Tool), which returns: \"The forecast at 3:00 PM is sunny, 75¬∞F.\" Security Boundary: Each client only communicates with its assigned server. The calendar server never sees weather data, and vice versa. Host: Aggregates the results and presents: \"You have a meeting at 3:00 PM. The weather at that time is expected to be sunny, 75¬∞F.\" Key Point: This example shows how MCP enables secure, modular, and orchestrated multi-tool workflows.

Background Context: Relevant information that helps the model understand the task's setting. Input/Output Structure: The format of information provided and the expected response format. The positioning of these components matters significantly. Due to the \"primacy-recency effect,\" models tend to pay more attention to information at the beginning and end of prompts, with content in the middle receiving less focus. [INSTRUCTIONS]: Create a summary of the following customer feedback that highlights key issues and one positive aspect. [BACKGROUND CONTEXT]: This feedback is from a user of our mobile banking app who has been a customer for 3 years and primarily uses the deposit and transfer features.

          "content": "The CRISP framework provides five fundamental principles that enhance model performance: C - Comprehensive Context Provide relevant background information that frames your request properly while avoiding unnecessary details. ‚ùå Poor Context (Missing key background): \"Analyze this customer feedback and suggest improvements.\" ‚ùå Poor Context (Too much irrelevant detail): \"I'm a store manager who's been working in retail for 15 years, graduated from State University with a business degree, and I drive a Honda Civic. Our store opened in 1987 and was renovated in 2019. The building has 45,000 square feet and we sell groceries. We have 87 employees and our store hours are 6am to 11pm. Analyze this customer feedback and suggest improvements.\" ‚úÖ Good Context (Just right): \"I'm a grocery store manager analyzing customer feedback from our mobile app users. Our store focuses on fresh produce and organic products, serving a health-conscious suburban demographic. Analyze this customer feedback and suggest improvements.\" R - Requirements Specification Clearly define task requirements, constraints, and parameters that guide the model to know when the assigned task is complete. ‚ùå Vague Requirements: \"I'm a grocery store manager. Look at this customer feedback about our produce section and tell me what to do.\" ‚úÖ Good Requirements: \"I'm a grocery store manager. Analyze this customer feedback about our produce section and provide exactly 3 actionable improvement recommendations. Each recommendation must be implementable within 30 days and cost less than $5,000.\" I - Input/Output Structure Define the format of information you're providing and the specific format you expect in return. ‚ùå No Structure: \"I'm a grocery store manager. Here's customer feedback about our produce section: [feedback text]. Give me 3 actionable improvements under $5,000 each.\" ‚úÖ Good Requirements: INPUT FORMAT: Customer feedback enclosed in triple backticks ``` [feedback text] ``` OUTPUT FORMAT: Provide exactly 3 recommendations using this structure: **Recommendation #:** [Title] **Cost Estimate:** [Amount] **Implementation Timeline:** [Days] **Expected Impact:** [Specific outcome] S - Specific Language Use precise, unambiguous terminology that eliminates confusion in your request. ‚ùå Vague Language: \"I'm a grocery store manager. Look at this customer feedback about our produce and give me some quick fixes that won't cost too much and will make customers happier soon.\" ‚úÖ Specific Language: \"I'm a grocery store manager. Analyze this customer feedback about our produce section and provide 3 operational improvements that can be implemented within 30 days, cost under $5,000 each, and directly address the quality issues mentioned in the feedback.\" P - Progressive Refinement Start simple and iterate by testing and evaluating until desired accuracy and performance are achieved. Note: Not every problem is best solved by prompt engineering. If you're struggling with latency, cost, or model limitations, consider switching models or adjusting system parameters instead of endlessly refining your prompt. Example: Applying the CRISP Framework ‚úó Poor Example: \"Create a meal plan for a vegetarian.\" ‚úì Good Example (Applying CRISP principles): C (Context): \"I'm a nutrition coach working with a 35-year-old female vegetarian athlete who trains 5 days per week.\" R (Requirements): \"She needs a 3-day meal plan meeting these requirements: 2500 calories daily, 120g protein, primarily whole foods, and no soy products due to allergies.\" I (Input/Output): \"Please format the plan as a daily schedule with meal names, ingredients, approximate calories, and protein content for each meal.\" S (Specific Language): Note the specific terms used throughout: \"3-day meal plan,\" \"2500 calories,\" \"120g protein,\" \"no soy products,\" \"meal names,\" \"ingredients,\" \"calories,\" and \"protein content\" instead of vague terms. ‚úì Progressively Refined Example (Adding P): \"You are an expert sports nutritionist specializing in plant-based diets for athletes. I'm a nutrition coach working with a 35-year-old female vegetarian athlete who trains 5 days per week for marathon running. She needs a 3-day meal plan meeting these requirements: 2500 calories daily, 120g protein, primarily whole foods, and no soy products due to allergies. For optimal performance, time her highest carbohydrate meals 2-3 hours before training sessions (typically at 6am). Please format the plan as a daily schedule with meal names, ingredients, approximate calories, and protein content for each meal, and include a brief explanation of how this plan supports her athletic performance.\"",

Tip: Using Extended Thinking For complex or multi-step tasks, enable extended thinking (if your model supports it) and start with high-level instructions like \"Think through this problem in detail and show your reasoning.\" If results are inconsistent, add more step-by-step guidance or few-shot examples using tags like <thinking>.

          "content": "In the previous modules, you learned the foundational building blocks of modern AI applications: Module 1 introduced you to Large Language Models (LLMs)‚Äîpowerful AI systems capable of understanding and generating human language. LLMs excel at reasoning, summarizing, answering questions, and more, but they operate within certain boundaries: they have no persistent memory, cannot access external tools or data, and do not act autonomously. Module 2 explored the art and science of prompt engineering‚Äîthe practice of crafting clear, effective instructions to get the best results from LLMs. With strong prompt engineering, you can build surprisingly capable applications using just an LLM, without any additional complexity. This module builds on your understanding of LLMs and prompt engineering, showing you how to design and build agents that can remember, reason, use tools, and act autonomously‚Äîunlocking a new level of capability for your AI applications. Hands-On Lab: Launch the companion lab notebook to practice building agentic LLM application. In the lab , you'll build a Personal Assistant ChatBot Agent for the course website that can search course content, generate thoughtful follow-up questions, remember conversation history, and make intelligent decisions about when to use which capabilities.",

In the 1980s and 1990s, the agent paradigm became more formalized in AI research, with researchers developing various types of agents from simple reactive systems to more complex deliberative architectures. Traditional AI literature identifies several key characteristics of agents: Autonomy: The ability to operate without direct human intervention Reactivity: The ability to perceive and respond to changes in the environment Pro-activeness: The ability to take initiative and pursue goals Social Ability: The ability to interact with other agents or humans However, it's crucial to understand that these characteristics exist on a spectrum rather than as binary attributes. Rather than thinking of agency as binary (either something is an agent or it's not), it's more helpful to consider a spectrum of agency, varying from highly supervised to fully autonomous.",

This is where LLM-powered agents come in. ü§ñ Agentic LLM application is a software system that wraps around the LLM, operating in a loop‚Äîobserving its environment, using the LLM's reasoning to decide what to do next, and taking actions to achieve its goals. LLM-powered agents build upon the foundation of Large Language Models by extending them with followingcritical capabilities: Tool Use: While base LLMs can only process and generate text, LLM-powered agents can interact with the world by using external tools, APIs, and services to retrieve information or perform actions. Persistent Memory: Unlike base LLMs limited to their context window, agents remember past actions, user preferences, or important facts (short-term and long-term). They can also use it to improve future actions. Orchestration Logic: Coordinates when and how to use the LLM, tools, and memory within each decision cycle, enabling adaptive, multi-step workflows. Figure: Core components of an LLM-powered agent. The agent orchestrates tool use, memory, and a decision cycle in response to user requests or tasks. These three capabilities transform LLMs from reactive language models into semi-autonomous systems that can reason, remember, and act to accomplish complex real-world tasks. ‚ö° For the remainder of this module, \"agents\" refers to Agentic LLM applications. The key differentiator from Workflow Based LLM Applications is the use of LLM to decide the control flow, and optionally, persistent memory for feedback loop and learning. These require careful engineering and enable agents to adapt to handle complex tasks flexibly at the cost of increased implementation complexity.",

How should the agent recover and continue? Memory Operations: What information should be stored after each interaction? When should past information be retrieved and used? How should conflicting information be handled? Loop Termination: How does the agent determine when a task is complete versus when to continue the decision cycle? What prevents infinite loops? This orchestration logic varies dramatically by use case - a research agent needs different decision patterns than a customer service agent or a data analysis agent.

          "content": "Not every application needs the complexity of an agent. Many tasks that can be completed in a single step or predefined workflows‚Äî like summarization, classification, or Q&A‚Äîcan be solved with just prompt engineering and a workflow-based approach. However, agents become essential when achieving your goals requires handling multi-step complex tasks and the workflow cannot be fully specified in advance‚Äîdemanding adaptive, dynamic decision-making. Guiding Principles for Using Agents: Don't Build Agents for Everything: Use agents only for complex, ambiguous, high-value tasks; prefer non-agentic workflows for simple cases. Keep It Simple: Start with a minimal architecture (environment, tools, prompt); iterate before adding complexity. The following table compares traditional workflows, LLM workflows, and agentic LLM Workflow based applications to help clarify when each approach is most appropriate. Dimension Traditional Workflows LLM Workflows Agentic Workflows Visual Description Software systems with predefined logic and workflows Applications that use LLMs in one or more fixed, code-defined steps‚Äîeach step may involve an LLM call or tool, but the workflow is predetermined and not dynamically chosen by the LLM. Systems operating in a loop‚Äîobserving its environment, using the LLM's reasoning to decide what to do next, and taking actions to achieve its goals Implementation Complexity Medium-High (requires specific logic for each task) Low-Medium (prompt engineering plus predefined integrations) High (requires orchestration, tool integration, memory systems) Applications & Examples Well-defined processes: order processing, data validation, reporting Tasks solved by running the LLM in one or more fixed, code-defined steps‚Äîsuch as content creation, simple chatbots, text-to-SQL, or multi-step data processing‚Äîwhere the workflow and tool use are predetermined and not dynamically chosen by the LLM. Complex tasks requiring multiple steps reasoning, external data, or persistent context. Customer service agents, research assistants, automated analysts Autonomy: Developer vs LLM The developer is fully responsible for all logic, control flow, and decision-making. The system follows code paths exactly as written. The developer still defines the overall workflow and control flow, but the LLM may be used for reasoning or generation within those steps. The LLM does not decide what step comes next. The LLM (within the agent) participates in or even drives the control flow, making decisions about which tools to use, when to use them, and how to proceed, based on the current context and goal. The developer provides the environment, tools, and guardrails, but the LLM has autonomy within those constraints. Reactivity Responds to specific triggers and data changes Responds to user prompts with enhanced context Responds to environmental changes and adapts strategy accordingly Pro-activeness Follows predetermined paths without initiative Reactive within single interactions, no cross-session initiative Takes initiative to pursue goals across multiple steps and sessions Social Ability Structured interactions with predefined interfaces Natural language conversation with enhanced responses Multi-turn dialogue with context awareness and goal persistence Tool Integration Pre-programmed connections to specific systems Predefined tool usage (RAG integrations, LLM output as tool input) LLM decides which tools to use; orchestrated tool selection with feedback loops Memory Management Database-driven with explicit schema design Context window concatenation (limited to context window size) Persistent across sessions with both short and long-term storage Reasoning Process Linear, rule-based or algorithmic Single-step or multi-step reasoning per interaction (may use CoT, ToT, ReAct within prompts) Multi-step reasoning across interactions with planning and feedback loops",

Agentic Workflow: Can interact with tools to translate documents, convert between different document types, and extract relevant fields‚Äîeven adapting its approach based on the document's structure or missing information.

The Agentic Decision Cycle: What Happens at Each Step? 1. Observes working memory which may include user input (latest message or command), recent conversation history, relevant memory (episodic, semantic, preferences), current environment state (results from API calls, databases queries etc.), and available tools/actions. 2. Plans next step to take based on what was observed, available tools and the current goal. Some Examples: Which tool(s) or action(s) to use next, what information to retrieve or store, how to structure the next prompt or response, whether to ask for clarification, proceed, or escalate, and how to handle errors or ambiguity. 3. Act on the plan by generating a response, calling a tool/API/external system, store or retrieve information from memory, ask clarifying questions, escalate to a human or another agent, or update internal state/goals. Step What the Agent Does Observe Observes working memory user input, context, memory, environment, and available tools Plan plans next step to take based on what was observed, available tools and the current goal Act Responds, calls tools/APIs, updates memory, asks questions, escalates, updates state Update: Claude 4.0 and Autonomous Tool Use Claude 4.0 (released May 22, 2025) introduced a major advance: the ability for the LLM to autonomously select and use tools (APIs, web search, code execution, etc.) as part of its reasoning process. This means that, at each decision point, the agent can now independently decide not only what to do, but also whether and how to use external tools‚Äîwithout explicit step-by-step instructions from the developer. This shift enables more adaptive, dynamic, and capable agentic applications, where the LLM itself orchestrates tool use to achieve complex goals. Learn more: Anthropic: Introducing Claude 4",

          "content": "Concept: The context window is the model's \"working memory\"‚Äîthe total number of tokens (chunks of text) it can consider at once. This includes both your input and the model's output. Modern AI models, known as transformers (introduced by Google), use an attention mechanism to focus on all tokens in this window simultaneously‚Äîbut nothing outside it. Everyday Example: Imagine a whiteboard with limited space. You write your question (input tokens) and leave room for the model's answer (output tokens). If your question fills the board, there's less space for the answer. If you run out of space, the model stops writing‚Äîeven mid-sentence. Your Prompt(e.g., 3,000 tokens) Model's Response(up to 5,000 tokens) Context Window: 8,000 tokens total (input + output) Why it matters: Hard limit: input tokens + output tokens ‚â§ max context window If your input is large, you have less room for the model's answer. If you hit the limit, the model will stop‚Äîsometimes in the middle of a sentence. This applies to all transformer models: OpenAI's GPT-4o/o1, Anthropic's Claude 3.7, and Amazon's Nova Premier. Cost control: Although foundational models have a maximum context window, most APIs let you set a smaller limit (using parameters like max_tokens) if you want to control costs or keep responses shorter. Note on Reasoning Models & Token Budgets: Newer models (like OpenAI's o1, Anthropic's Claude 3.7, and Amazon's Nova Premier) support very large context windows‚Äîsometimes up to 1 million tokens! These models can \"think\" for longer and do multi-step reasoning, but every step and intermediate thought also uses up tokens. Many APIs let you control this with a budget_tokens or reasoning budget parameter, so you can balance depth of reasoning with cost and performance. üí° Tip: Keep your prompts concise and leave enough space for the model's answer‚Äîespecially for complex tasks that need extended reasoning.",

          "content": "Concept: Tokenization splits text into small pieces called tokens that the model can process within its context window. Everyday Example: Think of tokenization like cutting a pizza. The whole pizza is your full text, and the slices are your tokens. Input Text: \"Machine learning is fascinating\" Model A tokenization: \"Machine\" \" learning\" \" is\" \" fascinating\" Model B tokenization: \"Machine\" \" learn\" \"ing\" \" is\" \" fascin\" \"ating\" Practical Application: Quick Token & Cost Estimation for Developers: For English, on average, 1 token ‚âà 4 characters (including spaces and punctuation) or ¬æ of a word. Reference: OpenAI Tokenizer How to use: Count words or characters in your input and expected output. Estimate tokens (words √ó 1.33 or characters √∑ 4). Add input and output tokens for total usage. Check your provider's pricing‚Äîmost charge less for input tokens and more for output tokens. Multiply by the respective rates to estimate total cost. Example: 375 words input ~ 500 tokens, 75 words output ~ 100 tokens ‚âà 600 tokens in context window.

          "content": "Concept: Logits are raw numerical scores the model assigns to each possible next token before making its final selection. First phase: The model splits the prompt into tokens, converts the tokens to embeddings, and processes the sequence of embeddings through its layers (e.g., transformer blocks), which use attention mechanisms to understand relationships and context. The model then produces logits‚Äîraw scores for every possible next token. These logits are converted to probabilities using the softmax function (see Wikipedia). This calculation phase is deterministic‚Äîidentical inputs always produce the same probability distribution. Second phase: The model selects tokens from this distribution, either deterministically (by always choosing the highest-probability token, if configured to do so) or with controlled randomness (to balance accuracy with creativity, depending on the sampling parameters). Everyday Example: When completing \"The capital of France is ____,\" a model assigns high scores to relevant answers like \"Paris\" and low scores to irrelevant options like \"banana.\" Input: \"The capital of France is\" How Token Selection Works Rank (k) Token Raw Logit Base Probability 1 \"Paris\" 8.2 80% 2 \"Lyon\" 4.6 10% 3 \"Nice\" 3.9 5% 4 \"Marseille\" 3.2 3% 5 \"banana\" -5.0 0.1% 6+ Other tokens varies 1.9% Temperature Modifies the probability distribution itself. Lower temperatures make the model more deterministic, leading to predictable outputs, while higher temperatures introduce more randomness and creativity. The allowed range depends on the provider and model‚Äîcheck your API documentation. Low (0.2): Makes likely tokens even more likely High (1.0): Makes distribution more uniform With temperature 0.2, \"Paris\" might be 95% likely topP (also called Nucleus Sampling) Uses a cumulative probability distribution. Sorts all possible next tokens by their probability (from highest to lowest). Then selects the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability adds up to the value of topP (e.g., 0.9 means the top tokens that together make up 90% of the probability) topP = 0.9: Only \"Paris\", \"Lyon\", \"Nice\" considered (95% cumulative) topP = 0.8: Only \"Paris\" considered (80% cumulative) It's more flexible than top-K because it dynamically adjusts the number of tokens based on their probabilities topK Considers only K most likely tokens topK = 3: Only \"Paris\", \"Lyon\", \"Nice\" considered topK = 1: Only \"Paris\" considered Fixed number regardless of probabilities üí°Tip: For most use cases, set either temperature or topP‚Äînot both. Controlling both can lead to unpredictable or unstable results, as both parameters affect randomness in different ways. Combined Effect: These parameters work together to control selection. Temperature modifies the distribution, then topP and topK filter which tokens can be selected from the modified distribution. Practical Application: The temperature, topP, and topK parameters control creativity vs. predictability in responses. These parameters let you balance deterministic, factual outputs with more creative, varied responses. Interactive: See How Temperature Changes Probabilities Adjust the temperature to see how the probability distribution changes for a generic set of logits. Temperature: 1.0 This chart uses a generic set of logits: [2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.0, -1.0]. Probabilities are calculated using the softmax function after scaling by temperature.",

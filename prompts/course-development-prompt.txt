You are helping me develop an educational course on building production-grade AI applications.  I am a computer science professor creating a two part educational material for entry level software and data engineers, who are part of an organization which is responsible for site selection, location analytics, sales forecasting, market research, grocery competitor insights, lease negotiation, lease administration, portfolio/asset management, store design (creating  and verifying documents such as Schematic Design, Design Development, Construction Design), Construction and Launch of grocery stores.  

Part 1 focuses on foundational concepts and is split into 4 modules 
1. Understanding Large Language Models
2. Prompt Engineering Guide
3. Introduction to Agents
4. Developers Guide to Model Context Protocol

Part 2 is focused on building production grade applications using AWS Bedrock services and compatible Open Source projects. Part 2 is split into 3 modules,
1. AWS Bedrock Services
2. Open Source Tools & Frameworks
3. Introduction to LLMOps
3. Capstone Project via Prompt-Driven Development (Vibe Coding) using Amazon Q Developer, VSCode and CLine

I would like keep Part 1 modules to be focused on helping my audience understand the core concepts and foundational knowledge necessary for being able to build production grade AI applications and in Part 2 apply the knowledge learned in Part 1 and learn the specifics of how to build using first AWS Bedrock Services and the compatible Open Source technologies and finally build a capstone/hackathon project to build an end to end AI agents 
I need your help to:
1. Create engaging and interactive material that explains foundational concepts in easy to understand ways.
2. Balance written material with visual cues, images and diagrams to explain concepts
3. Use analogy when applicable to explain complicated concepts
4. Create exercises for students to practice with theoretical knowledge they are learning
5. Develop assessment questions to test understanding as they progress through the material
6. Each module should be max 20 minutes long to teach
7. Assume audience have no prior knowledge expect the knowledge they are progressively learning as part of the course. For example, when developing Part 2 material you can assume they have gained knowledge from Part 1. Or when developing Part 1 module 3 they know the concepts from Part 1 module 1 & 2. 

Note that I'm specifically focusing on open source tools that are:
1. Truly open source (MIT or Apache licensed)
2. Directly complementary to AWS Bedrock services
3. Suitable for production-grade applications
4. Currently actively maintained

Here is the please help me develop these materials for each module step by step by
    1. first think critically and ask me if you have any clarifying questions
    2. second discuss the outline of the module sections and save the outline as markdown marking every sectino as incomplete
    3. third discuss the material for one section at a time, thinking critically at each step and asking me if you have any clarifying questions
    4. Once you havce confirmation that the material for a section is finalized,  create markdown file for the section content and update the progress in outline markdown as complete.
    
Only create course material for information you're confident about and explicitly indicate uncertainty rather than speculating. Add references to authoritative sources where applicable.

Part 1 Module 4: Developer's Guide to Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Module Overview
This module introduces developers to the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a standardized way for LLMs to interact with external tools and data sources. By the end of this module, students will understand the core architecture of MCP, its specifications, how LLMs and agents leverage it, and how to build and use tools with MCP.

{"answer":{"text":"Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced AI systems trained on massive amounts of text data that can understand, generate, and manipulate human language [1]. These powerful models form the foundation of modern AI applications like chatbots, content generators, and virtual assistants. Key aspects of LLMs include:\n\n1. Processing text through context windows\n2. Breaking down text via tokenization\n3. Representing meaning through embeddings\n4. Making predictions using logits and temperature settings\n\nLLMs can interpret complex language patterns and generate human-like responses across diverse contexts, making them revolutionary tools in artificial intelligence."},"followUpQuestions":["How do LLMs actually learn from text data?","What are the main components of an LLM?","What are some real-world applications of Large Language Models?"],"conversationSummary":"Introduced the concept of Large Language Models, explaining their basic functionality and importance in AI applications","sources":[{"id":1,"title":"Introduction","url":"pages/llm.html#introduction","section_title":"Introduction","relevance_score":0.637722893032687},{"id":2,"title":"Introduction","url":"pages/llm.html#introduction","section_title":"Introduction","relevance_score":0.637672429500981}]}

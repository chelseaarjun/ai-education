## Overview

This repository contains interactive web-based lessons designed to teach fundamental concepts about Large Language Models and prompt engineering. The materials are suitable for students, developers, and professionals looking to understand how LLMs work and how to effectively interact with them.

## Contents

### 1. LLM Concepts Lesson
An in-depth exploration of how Large Language Models work, covering:

- **Context Windows**: Understanding token limitations and management
- **Tokenization**: How text is broken down for processing
- **Embeddings**: Semantic understanding and vector representations
- **Logits & Token Selection**: How models generate text responses
- **Response Formatting**: Structured vs. unstructured outputs
- **Reasoning Capabilities**: How models break down complex problems
- **Model Specifications**: Detailed information about Claude 3.7 Sonnet

### 2. Prompt Engineering Lesson
A practical guide to crafting effective prompts, including:

- **Prompt Fundamentals**: Basic concepts and input-output relationships
- **Prompt Structure**: Instructions, context, examples, and output formats
- **Basic Techniques**:
  - Zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting
  - Role-based prompting
  - Constraint-based prompting
  - System vs. user prompts
- **Advanced Techniques**: Using libraries like LangChain, Jinja templates, and Pydantic

## Features

- **Interactive Learning**: Quizzes, interactive demos, and simulated AI responses
- **Visual Explanations**: Diagrams and visual aids to explain complex concepts
- **Code Examples**: Practical implementation examples using Python and AWS Bedrock
- **Hands-on Practice**: Opportunities to craft and test different prompting strategies

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-education.git
   cd ai-education
   ```

2. Open the index.html file in your web browser:
   ```
   open index.html
   ```

3. Navigate through the lessons using the course navigation menu.

## Technical Requirements

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- No server required - all lessons run client-side
- For code examples: Python 3.8+ with appropriate libraries (LangChain, Pydantic, etc.)

## Using the Code Examples

The code examples in the lessons demonstrate integration with AWS Bedrock and Claude models. To run these examples:

1. Install required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install langchain boto3 pydantic jinja2
   ```

2. Configure AWS credentials for Bedrock access
3. Modify region and model parameters as needed for your environment

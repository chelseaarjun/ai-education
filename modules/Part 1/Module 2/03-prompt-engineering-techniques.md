## 3. Prompt Engineering Techniques
Beyond fundamental principles, prompt engineering includes specialized techniques that can significantly enhance model performance for specific tasks and scenarios. This toolkit of advanced approaches allows you to progressively refine your prompts when facing complex challenges, moving from simpler techniques to more sophisticated methods, only as needed, to achieve your desired outcomes.

### 3.1 Intermediate Techniques

#### 3.1.1 Role Assignment
**What it is:** Assigning the model a specific role, expertise, or perspective to frame its responses.

**When to use it:**
- To access domain-specific knowledge frameworks
- To establish a consistent tone and perspective
- To invoke specific methodologies or analytical approaches

**Example:**
```
You are an experienced security engineer with expertise in OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. Review the following API endpoint code and identify potential security risks, categorizing them according to the OWASP framework:

```

#### 3.1.2 Self-Consistency and Verification
**What it is:** Instructing the model to verify its work, consider alternatives, or challenge assumptions.

**When to use it:**
- For critical applications where accuracy is paramount
- When the task has multiple valid solution paths
- For complex reasoning tasks with high potential for errors

**Example:**
```
Analyze the following contract clause for potential legal ambiguities:

[contract clause]

After your initial analysis, review your own conclusions by considering counter-arguments and alternative interpretations. Then provide your final assessment.
```

#### 3.1.3 Prompt Chaining
**What it is:** Breaking complex tasks into a series of simpler prompts where the output of each serves as input to the next.

**When to use it:**
- For complex tasks better handled as a sequence of focused sub-tasks
- When initial outputs need refinement or enrichment
- To create more controllable and debuggable systems

**Example:**
```
First prompt: "Extract all the technical requirements from this product specification document: [document]"

Second prompt: "Based on these requirements: [output from first prompt], create a system architecture diagram and explain the key components."
```

#### 3.1.4 Few-Shot Prompting
**What it is:** Providing examples of the desired input-output pairs before asking the model to perform the task.

**When to use it:**
- When the format or style of response is difficult to explain but easy to demonstrate
- When the model is consistently misunderstanding a nuanced task
- For specialized domain tasks where showing examples clarifies expectations

**Important note:** With recent reasoning-focused models, start with a zero-shot approach and only add examples if the model's initial performance is inadequate.

**Reference:** Li et al. (2023). "Large Language Models Can Be Easily Distracted by Irrelevant Context." Microsoft Research & University of Washington. https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00093

**Example:**
```
Classify the following customer inquiries by department (Technical Support, Billing, Sales, or General Information):

Example 1:
Customer: "I can't log into my account after the recent update."
Department: Technical Support

Example 2:
Customer: "I'd like to upgrade to the enterprise plan."
Department: Sales

Now classify this inquiry:
Customer: "I was charged twice for my monthly subscription."
Department:
```

### 3.2 Advanced Techniques Toolkit

#### 3.2.1 Chain-of-Thought Prompting
**What it is:** Instructing the model to work through a problem step-by-step, showing its reasoning process.

<!-- Insert: ![Chain of Thought Diagram](../../../../assets/images/chain-of-thought-diagram.svg) -->

**When to use it:**
- For complex problems requiring multiple logical steps
- When you need to verify the model's reasoning
- For teaching purposes where the reasoning process is important

**Important note:** Chain-of-Thought can be invoked in two main ways:
  1. Using a simple instruction like "Think step-by-step" or "Let's solve this step-by-step"
  2. Providing examples that demonstrate the reasoning process (few-shot approach)
Modern reasoning-focused models often perform chain-of-thought reasoning implicitly, but explicitly requesting step-by-step reasoning remains valuable for auditing the model's thought process and identifying potential errors.

**Reference:** Wei et al. (2022). "Emergent Abilities of Large Language Models." Transactions on Machine Learning Research. https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07682

**Example:**
```
Question: A retail store is running a promotion where customers get 30% off their purchase, and loyalty members get an additional 15% off the discounted price. If a loyalty member buys items totaling $250, how much will they pay?

Please solve this step-by-step:
```

#### 3.2.2 Tree of Thoughts Prompting
**What it is:** An advanced reasoning technique that explores multiple potential solution paths simultaneously rather than following a single linear chain of thought.

**When to use it:**
- For complex problems where the first solution approach might not be successful
- For tasks requiring creative exploration, like puzzles or complex planning
- For teaching purposes where the reasoning process is important
- When the highest possible accuracy is needed for difficult reasoning tasks

**Important note:** Tree of Thoughts can be implemented either programmatically (using search algorithms to explore multiple paths) or through carefully structured prompts that encourage the model to consider multiple approaches simultaneously.

**Reference:** Yao et al. (2023). "Tree of Thoughts: Deliberate Problem Solving with Large Language Models." Princeton University, Google DeepMind. https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10601

**Example:**
```
Solve this problem by exploring three different solution approaches. For each approach: 
1. Start with a different initial strategy 
2. Develop the solution step-by-step 
3. Evaluate if this approach is likely to succeed or reach a dead end 

After exploring all three approaches, select the most promising one and complete it to find the final answer. 

Problem: A farmer needs to cross a river with a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage. The boat can only carry the farmer and one item at a time. If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, and the goat would eat the cabbage. How can the farmer get all three across safely?
```

#### 3.2.3 ReAct (Reasoning + Acting)
**What it is:** A prompting technique that combines reasoning with action in an iterative cycle, alternating between thinking about a problem and taking concrete steps to solve it.

<!-- Insert: ![ReAct Diagram](../../../../assets/images/react-diagram.svg) -->

**When to use it:**
- For complex tasks requiring both analytical reasoning and specific actions
- When working with tools or external systems (like search engines, databases, or APIs)
- For multi-step problem-solving that benefits from "thinking and doing" cycles
- When implementing agent-based architectures

**Important note:** While modern reasoning models perform many reasoning steps implicitly, the ReAct pattern remains valuable for structuring tool use in agent systems. Libraries like LangChain abstract much of the implementation complexity through functions like `create_react_agent` (see [LangChain ReAct documentation](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/langchain/agents/langchain.agents.react.agent.create_react_agent.html)) that handle the reasoning-action-observation loop behind the scenes, allowing developers to focus on defining tools and goals rather than the mechanics of implementing the pattern.

**Reference:** Yao et al. (2022). "ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models." Google Research. https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629

**Example:**
```
You are a customer support analyst solving a technical issue. For this problem:
1. THINK: Analyze what might be causing the issue based on the symptoms
2. ACT: Suggest a specific diagnostic step to gather more information
3. OBSERVE: Consider what the results of this step would tell you
4. DECIDE: Based on this reasoning, determine the next action to take

Customer issue: "When I try to upload photos to your website, it gets stuck at 90% every time. I've tried different browsers but have the same problem."
```

#### 3.2.4 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
**What it is:** Enhancing prompts with relevant external information retrieved from documents or knowledge bases.

<!-- Insert: ![RAG System Architecture](../../../../assets/images/RAG.png) -->

**When to use it:**
- When the model needs specific information outside its training
- For tasks requiring domain-specific knowledge
- When up-to-date or proprietary information is essential
- To reduce hallucinations by grounding responses in verified data

**Important note:** RAG is primarily an architectural pattern that works by retrieving relevant information and incorporating it into the prompt's context.

**Example:**
```
Using the following sections from our company's security policy document, answer the employee's question about acceptable use of personal devices:

[retrieved policy sections]

Employee question: "Am I allowed to access work emails on my personal smartphone?"
```

### 3.3 Selecting the Right Techniques

Choose techniques based on specific needs rather than complexity for its own sake:

1. **Start with CRISP fundamentals**: A well-structured prompt following CRISP principles often yields excellent results without additional techniques.
2. **Address specific issues**: Introduce techniques only to solve identified problems.
3. **Consider model capabilities**: More advanced models may require fewer prompting techniques.
4. **Evaluate the tradeoffs**: More complex techniques often come with increased token usage and potential for confusion.
5. **Test systematically**: Document which techniques work best for specific use cases.

In production applications, maintain a library of effective prompts, implement version control, and establish monitoring systems to track performance.

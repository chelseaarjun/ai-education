**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is a standardized protocol that enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with external tools, APIs, and data sources in a structured and secure way.

- **Definition:** MCP specifies how LLMs can send and receive structured messages to perform actions beyond simple text generation.
- **Purpose:** It allows LLMs to access real-time information, perform complex operations, and integrate seamlessly with business processes and external systems.

### Why Was MCP Created, and Why Does It Matter?

> **The Challenge:**  
> As LLMs became more powerful, developers wanted to connect them to external tools and data. Early attempts relied on custom, one-off solutions, which were difficult to maintain, inconsistent, and often insecure.

- **Historical Context:**  
  MCP was developed by Anthropic in response to these challenges. The goal was to create a universal, standardized way for LLMs to safely and reliably interact with the outside world.

- **Why It Matters:**  
  - **Standardization:** MCP provides a common language for tool integration, reducing fragmentation and making it easier for developers to connect LLMs with a wide range of tools.
  - **Security and Control:** By defining clear protocols and permissions, MCP helps ensure that LLMs interact with external systems in a safe, auditable, and controlled manner.
  - **Unlocks New Capabilities:** With MCP, LLMs can go beyond static knowledge, enabling dynamic, real-world applications such as data analysis, workflow automation, and more.

### What Does the MCP Protocol Cover?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** defines how AI-powered applications and tools interact, covering:

- **Architecture:** The roles and responsibilities of the host, client, and server in an MCP system.
- **Base Protocol** Core JSON-RPC message types.  The structure and types of messages exchanged, including requests, responses, notifications, and errors.
- **Connection Lifecycle:** How sessions are initialized, maintained, and ended between clients and servers
- **Client Features** The core functions MCP enables, such as resources, tools, prompts, and sampling.
- **Server Features** The core functions MCP enables, such as resources, tools, prompts, and sampling.
- **Security, Error Handling & Versioning:** secure communication, error management, and protocol evolution

Together, these elements make MCP a robust, extensible, and secure foundation for advanced AI integrations.

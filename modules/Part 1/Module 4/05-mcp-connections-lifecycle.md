## MCP Connection Lifecycle

---

### Overview

The connection lifecycle in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) defines how a session is established, maintained, and terminated between a client and a server, with the host orchestrating the process. This lifecycle ensures robust, secure, and feature-negotiated communication for all MCP-compliant integrations.

*The diagram above illustrates the key phases and message flows in a typical MCP session, including initialization, active session management, requests, notifications, and termination.*

### Lifecycle Phases

#### 1. Initialization
- **Host initializes the client** and starts the session.
- **Client sends an initialization request** to the server, declaring its supported capabilities (features, protocol version, etc.).
- **Server responds** with its own supported capabilities.
- **Negotiation:** Only the features supported by both client and server are enabled for the session.

#### 2. Active Session with Negotiated Features
- Once initialized, the session enters an active state where both sides know which features are available.
- **Client Requests:**
  - User- or model-initiated actions trigger requests from the client to the server (e.g., requesting tools or resources).
  - The server processes the request and sends a response.
  - The client updates the UI or responds to the model as needed.
- **Server Requests:**
  - The server can initiate requests to the client (e.g., sampling requests for LLM completions).
  - The client forwards these to the AI and returns the response to the server.
- **Notifications:**
  - Either side can send notifications for events like resource updates or status changes.
  - Notifications do not expect a response and are used for real-time updates.

#### 3. Termination
- Either the host or client can terminate the session when work is complete or an error occurs.
- The session ends cleanly, and all resources are released.

### Key Points
- **Capability negotiation** during initialization ensures only mutually supported features are active.
- **Requests** and **notifications** flow in both directions, enabling rich, interactive workflows.
- **Termination** is explicit, ensuring clean shutdown and resource management.

# Decision Cycle: Observe, Plan, and Act

In the context of AI agents for digital applications (like chatbots, virtual assistants, or workflow automation), the **decision cycle** is the repeating process an agent uses to understand, reason, and act—much like how a human knowledge worker would handle a task.

## What is the Decision Cycle?

*This diagram illustrates how the agent's memory, tools, and decision logic interact in a continuous decision cycle, enabling the agent to observe, plan, and act in digital environments.*

The decision cycle is a loop where the agent:
1. **Observes** the current situation (e.g., receives a user message or new data).
2. **Plans** what to do next by combining what it knows (memory), what it can do (tools), and the current goal.
3. **Acts** by generating a response, calling a tool, retrieving information, or escalating to a human if needed.

After acting, the agent updates its memory and starts the cycle again for the next input or task. The agent's "brain" (the LLM and its code) brings together memory and tools to decide the best next step in each cycle.

## Separation of Responsibilities: Agent vs. LLM

- The **LLM** is a powerful tool for language and reasoning, but it doesn't have persistent memory, tool access, or the ability to act autonomously.
- The **agent** a software system that wraps around the LLM, orchestratoring when to call the LLM, what to ask, how to use the response, and how to interact with the environment (including databases, APIs, or human-in-the-loop steps).

**Why This Matters:**  
This separation allows for more robust, flexible, and safe AI systems. The agent can use the LLM as a component, while also integrating other capabilities and enforcing business logic or safety checks.

## Building Agents: Do You Need a Library?

You don't strictly need a library to build an agent—at its core, an agent is a software system that manages memory, tool use, and decision logic around an LLM. However, building a robust agent from scratch can be complex and time-consuming.

**Popular open-source agent frameworks include:**
- **LangChain** (Python, JS): Modular framework for building LLM-powered agents with memory, tools, and workflows.
- **CrewAI**: Focuses on multi-agent collaboration and workflow orchestration.
- **Autogen** (Microsoft): For building multi-agent and tool-using systems.

These libraries provide reusable components, integrations, and best practices, making it much easier and safer to build production-grade agents.

## Example (Customer Support Chatbot)

1. **Observe:** The user asks, "What's my order status?"
2. **Plan:** The agent checks its memory for recent orders, decides it needs up-to-date info, and chooses to use an external tool (API) to fetch the order status.
3. **Act:** The agent retrieves the status and replies, "Your order is out for delivery and should arrive today."

The agent then updates its memory with this interaction, ready for the next question.

## Quiz

**Question:**  
Which of the following best describes the agent decision cycle in a digital assistant?

A) The agent only responds to user input without using memory or tools  
B) The agent observes, plans, acts, and updates its memory in a repeating loop  
C) The agent always escalates to a human for every task  
D) The agent only uses pre-programmed responses

**Correct Answer:**  
**B) The agent observes, plans, acts, and updates its memory in a repeating loop**

## Module 3 Summary

In this module, you learned how modern AI agents are designed to go beyond simple text generation. You explored:
- The fundamentals of what makes an AI agent, including the importance of memory, tools, and the decision cycle
- How agents use different types of memory (working, episodic, semantic, procedural) to remember, reason, and act
- The various ways agents interact with external environments using tools and integration patterns
- The decision cycle as the core loop that enables agents to observe, plan, act, and learn—mirroring the way human knowledge workers handle tasks
- The importance of separating the agent's orchestration logic from the LLM's language and reasoning capabilities, and how frameworks like LangChain, CrewAI, and others can help you build robust, production-ready agents

By understanding these concepts, you're now equipped to design and build AI agents that can autonomously assist, augment, or automate knowledge work in digital applications.

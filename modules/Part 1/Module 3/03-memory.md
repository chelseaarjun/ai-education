# Memory: Retaining and Utilizing Information

## What is Memory in AI Agents?

Memory allows an agent to retain and use information from previous interactions, tasks, or experiences. This enables agents to be more effective, adaptive, and context-aware.

**Analogy:**  
Just as humans remember important facts, past conversations, or how to perform tasks, agents use memory to recall relevant information and improve their performance.

## Types of Memory

- **Short-Term Memory (Context Window):**  
  Holds recent information, such as the current conversation or task.  
  *Example:* Remembering the last question a user asked.

- **Procedural Memory:**  
  Remembers how to perform tasks or actions.  
  *Example:* Knowing the steps to process a document.

- **Episodic Memory:**  
  Stores specific events or experiences.  
  *Example:* Recalling a previous interaction with a particular user.

- **Semantic Memory:**  
  Contains general knowledge and facts.  
  *Example:* Knowing that "lease" is a type of legal agreement.

## How Agents Use Memory

Agents use memory to:
- Personalize responses based on user history
- Track progress in multi-step tasks
- Avoid repeating actions or mistakes
- Reference facts or data from earlier in a session

**Visual:**  
*Diagram idea: Agent with two "memory banks"—one for short-term (context window) and one for long-term (episodic, procedural, semantic)—with arrows showing information flowing between them.*

**Scenario:**  
An agent is helping a user with lease negotiations. It remembers the user's preferred lease terms from a previous session and uses that information to suggest new options.

**Question:**  
Which type of memory is the agent using?

A) Procedural  
B) Episodic  
C) Short-term  
D) Musical

**Correct Answer:**  
**B) Episodic**

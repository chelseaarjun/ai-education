## Learning Objectives:
By the end of this module, students will be able to:
1. **Explain the purpose and capabilities** of each AWS Bedrock service
2. **Identify key features** that make each service valuable for production AI applications
3. **Understand the benefits** that managed AI services provide over custom implementations
4. **Recognize limitations and constraints** of each Bedrock service
5. **Determine appropriate use cases** for each service in production environments
6. **Prepare for informed decision-making** when comparing alternatives in future modules

## Module Focus:
This module provides deep understanding of AWS Bedrock's capabilities without comparisons to alternatives. Students will gain solid foundational knowledge of what each service offers, preparing them to make informed architectural decisions when open source alternatives are introduced in the next module.

## Assessment Questions: ❌ INCOMPLETE
- 6 multiple choice questions covering service capabilities, benefits, limitations, and appropriate use cases

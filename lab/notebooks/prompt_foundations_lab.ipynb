    "\n",
    "With Claude 3.7 Sonnet on AWS Bedrock, you can enable explicit step-by-step reasoning (\"extended thinking\") using special API parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set `thinking: true` and specify a `budget_tokens` value in your API request. thinking mode is OFF by default. \n",
    "- The model will return its reasoning process in separate `thinking` blocks, in addition to the final answer.\n",
    "- You cannot use `temperature`, `top_p`, or `top_k` with reasoning mode enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best Practices for Reasoning Mode (`thinking`) in Claude 3.7 Sonnet\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Always set** `budget_tokens < max_tokens`.\n",
    "- **Minimum** `budget_tokens`: **1,024** tokens  \n",
    "  _Anthropic recommends at least **4,000** tokens for more comprehensive and nuanced reasoning._\n",
    "- **For multi-turn conversations:**  \n",
    "  Preserve and return the **complete, unmodified `thinking` blocks** to maintain context and reasoning continuity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Important Notes\n",
    "- **Incompatible parameters:**: You **cannot use** `temperature`, `top_p`, or `top_k` with reasoning mode enabled.\n",
    "- **Billing:**: You are **billed for thinking tokens** as output tokens. They also count towards your service quota token per minute (TPM) limit.\n",
    "- **Redacted thinking blocks:**: May appear if the reasoning output does not meet safety standards.\n",
    "- **Multi-turn conversations:**: Thinking blocks associated with earlier assistant messages do **not** get charged as input tokens.\n",
    "- **Increased latency**: Plan for longer response times due to extra processing and output generation and adjust your client timeouts accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example API call:**\n",
    "```json\n",

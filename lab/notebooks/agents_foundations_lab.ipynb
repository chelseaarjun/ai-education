    "# 🎯 Lab Summary & Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've built a complete AI agent from scratch. Let's review what you've accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏗️ What You Built\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Content Search Tool** - Semantic search using embeddings and FAISS\n",
    "2. **Follow-up Question Generator** - LLM-as-tool for educational enhancement\n",
    "3. **Agent Orchestration** - Decision logic for tool coordination\n",
    "4. **Episodic Memory** - Conversation history for context continuity\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Key Concepts Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent vs LLM Application\n",
    "- **LLM Application**: Single-step input → output processing\n",
    "- **Agent**: Multi-step reasoning with tools, memory, and adaptive behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool Patterns\n",
    "- **Retrieval Tools**: Access external information (search, databases)\n",
    "- **Generative Tools**: Create new content using LLMs\n",
    "- **Clean Interfaces**: Well-structured inputs/outputs for reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "### Memory Types\n",
    "- **Working Memory**: Current context and reasoning\n",
    "- **Episodic Memory**: Conversation history and past interactions\n",
    "- **Integration Strategy**: Developer vs LLM-controlled retrieval\n",
    "\n",
    "### Orchestration Patterns\n",
    "- **Observe**: Analyze input and retrieve relevant context\n",
    "- **Plan**: Decide which tools to use and in what order\n",
    "- **Act**: Execute the plan and generate responses\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🚀 Looking Forward\n",
    "\n",
    "Your agent demonstrates the fundamental patterns of modern AI applications. In production systems, you might see:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **More sophisticated memory systems** (vector databases, semantic memory)\n",
    "- **Advanced orchestration frameworks** (LangChain, CrewAI)\n",
    "- **Multi-agent collaboration** (specialized agents working together)\n",
    "- **Human-in-the-loop systems** (approval workflows, escalation)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Extension Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "Want to enhance your agent further? Try:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Add more tools** (calculator, web search, code executor)\n",
    "2. **Implement user preferences** (learning style, preferred topics)\n",
    "3. **Add error recovery** (retry logic, fallback strategies)\n",
    "4. **Create specialized agents** (different personas for different subjects)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**🎉 Congratulations on completing the AI Agents Foundations Lab!**\n",
    "\n",
    "You now understand the core principles of building production-grade AI agents and have hands-on experience with the patterns that power modern agentic applications.\n"

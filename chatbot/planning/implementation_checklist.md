## Cursor Workflow Tips

### Starting Each Phase
1. **Open the relevant prompt** from the prompts document
2. **Copy the specific Cursor prompt** for the feature
3. **Paste into Cursor** with context: "I'm building an AI education chatbot"
4. **Reference the planning docs** if Cursor needs more context
5. **Iterate and refine** the generated code

### Debugging with Cursor
```
"The chatbot API is returning errors. Here's the error log: [paste log]. 
Based on the planning documentation, help me debug and fix this issue."
```

### Adding Features
```
"Based on the chatbot architecture, add [feature] to the existing code. 
Maintain the current design patterns and error handling approach."
```

### Testing with Cursor
```
"Create tests for this chatbot component. Follow the testing strategy 
from the planning docs and focus on integration testing."
```

## Success Metrics Tracking

### Daily Checks
- [ ] Response time < 2 seconds
- [ ] No API errors
- [ ] Costs within budget ($0.30/day max)
- [ ] User interactions working

### Weekly Review
- [ ] Analytics review
- [ ] Cost analysis
- [ ] User feedback assessment
- [ ] Performance optimization opportunities

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Cursor Prompts

**Widget not loading:**
```
"The chat widget isn't loading on the website. Check the JavaScript 
console errors and fix the integration issues."
```

**API errors:**
```
"The chatbot API is failing with [error]. Review the error handling 
and Claude API integration code."
```

**High costs:**
```
"The chatbot costs are higher than expected. Analyze the caching 
and rate limiting implementation for optimization opportunities."
```

**Poor responses:**
```
"The chatbot isn't giving good responses to course questions. 
Review the content search and prompt engineering logic."
```
